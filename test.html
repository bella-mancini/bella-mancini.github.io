    As the nature of this work is confidential I won't be able to show any project visuals for the time being.
    However, I can provide a description of the work I've done. 
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, I created an employee relations tracker which will be used by the HR Bussiness partners for case management.
    The app included a main dashboard that housed all the cases with buttons to edit each one and create a new case. When click the new case button there is 
    a toggle for the main case and the case notes. Within the main case there are people lookup feilds with multiple selections 
    as well as long text fields that grow as they type. The case notes would be used to make specific notes for interviews of each person involved in a case
    which has a fillout able form on the right and a list of all case notes on the left. I also included a button on the screen to open a new window launching
    a guide to interviews of witnesses, accusers, and the accused. When they are satisfied with the information they entered they can hit sumbit which takes them
    back to the home screen where they can see the new case on the dashboard. All of these cases have edit buttons to populate the data on the form into the 
    case information screen that can be easily edited.

    In my image class my favorite 3 projects from each section display my ability to use
    photoshop, adobe premiere pro, and VR software. We worked with image in a 2D space, 2D with motion
    and 3D with motion. Each of these pieces is from each section of the class respectively.

        In my Text class I learned all about text from fonts, colors, and placement. This class
        was heavily graphic design focused and I working on a couple larger projects. My favorites being 
        a poster mailer for the Colorado Symphony and a product branding for cereal.

    In this class I learned how to 3D model in blender and turn digital models into physical models. I worked with
    many different materials and processes, some of my favorite being 3D printing, laser cutting, and woodworking.
