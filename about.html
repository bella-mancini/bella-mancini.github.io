    <h2>
        Academic
    </h2>
        <p>
        My name is Isabella Mancini (she/her) and I'm a current Junior at the University of Colorado Boulder.
        I'm pursuing a B.S. in Creative Technology and Design in the School of Engineering with an art minor. My major is an interdisipinary between Computer Science and Design which has
        allowed me to learn the most used coding languages and how to blanace all elements of Design. To see my design process
        you can <a href="https://isabellamanciniprocessblog.wordpress.com">click here</a> and follow the link to 
        my work in progess blog. To see my code for all of my classes thus far you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/bella-mancini">github</a>  here.

    <h2>
        Professional
    </h2>
        <p>
        As far as professional experience, I have had customer service experience since I was in high school in the food industry
        and retail which gave me a great understanding of how to work with people and develop a great work ethic. 
        <p></p>
        The summer of 2023 I was given the amazing oppurtunity to work with a company named Covestro as a HR Technology and 
        Digitializtion intern. Working in a global companies HR department's internal technology team gave me a better insight into how companies are run and the technology that 
        supports it. I created back to front end code (Python) and used Microsoft the Power Apps tool to push out 8 apps throughout the summer.
        These apps where requested by HR Business Partners and other employees to stream line processes and where in a variety of 
        areas from compensation to employee relations. Each of these apps included automated workflows (PowerAuntomate) 
        and created data achetecture repositories (PostgresSQL/ Sharepoint) to support applications. To create these apps I used the iterative design 
        process by meeting with stakeholders to collect requirements, crafting wireframes (Figma), and supporting senior teammates in implementatiion, testing, and deployment.
        <p></p>
        For example, I created an employee relations tracker which will be used by the HR Bussiness partners for case management.
        The app included a main dashboard that housed all the cases with buttons to edit each one and create a new case. When click the new case button there is 
        a toggle for the main case and the case notes. Within the main case there are people lookup feilds with multiple selections 
        as well as long text fields that grow as they type. The case notes would be used to make specific notes for interviews of each person involved in a case
        which has a fillout able form on the right and a list of all case notes on the left. I also included a button on the screen to open a new window launching
        a guide to interviews of witnesses, accusers, and the accused. When they are satisfied with the information they entered they can hit sumbit which takes them
        back to the home screen where they can see the new case on the dashboard. All of these cases have edit buttons to populate the data on the form into the 
        case information screen that can be easily edited.

        Personal Life
    </h2>
        <p>
        Outside of my academics I like to hike, run, and do anything artistic. I am currently training for a 10k and one of my 
        biggest acomplishments is that I ran a half maraton in high school. Being outside in general just brings me peace and I love 
        being active. I also draw alot (as you can see from my portfolio). Mostly mixed media and I specficially like sketching with pen 
        and paper.
