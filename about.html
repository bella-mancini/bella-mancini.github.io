        Academic
    </h2>
        <p>
        My name is Isabella Mancini (she/her) and I'm a current Junior at the University of Colorado Boulder.
        I'm pursuing a B.S. in Creative Technology and Design in the School of Engineering with an art minor. My major is an interdisipinary between Computer Science and Design which has
        allowed me to learn the most used coding languages and how to blanace all elements of Design. To see my design process
        you can <a href="https://isabellamanciniprocessblog.wordpress.com">click here</a> and follow the link to 
        my work in progess blog. To see my code for all of my classes thus far you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/bella-mancini">github</a>  here.

        supports it. I

    <h2>
        Personal Life
    </h2>
        <p>
        Outside of my academics I like to hike, run, and do anything artistic. I am currently training for a 10k and one of my 
        biggest acomplishments is that I ran a half maraton in high school. Being outside in general just brings me peace and I love 
        being active. I also draw alot (as you can see from my portfolio). Mostly mixed media and I specficially like sketching with pen 
        and paper.
