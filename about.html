                        My name is Isabella Mancini (she/her) and I'm a current Senior at the University of Colorado Boulder.
                        I'm pursuing a B.S. in Creative Technology and Design in the School of Engineering with an art minor. 
                        My major is an interdisipinary between Computer Science and Design which has
                        allowed me to learn the most used coding languages and how to blanace all elements of Design. To see my work

                        <p>
                        As far as professional experience, I have had customer service experience since I was in high school in the food industry
                        and retail which gave me a great understanding of how to work with people and develop a great work ethic. 
                        <p></p>
                        The summer of 2023 I was given the amazing oppurtunity to work with a company named Covestro as a HR Technology and 
                        Digitializtion intern. Working in a global companies HR department's internal technology team gave me a better insight into how companies are run and the technology that 
                        supports it. I created back to front end code (Python) and used Microsoft the Power Apps tool to push out 8 apps throughout the summer.
                        These apps where requested by HR Business Partners and other employees to stream line processes and where in a variety of 
                        areas from compensation to employee relations. Each of these apps included automated workflows (PowerAuntomate) 
                        and created data achetecture repositories (PostgresSQL/ Sharepoint) to support applications. To create these apps I used the iterative design 
                        process by meeting with stakeholders to collect requirements, crafting wireframes (Figma), and supporting senior teammates in implementatiion, testing, and deployment.

                        In the summer of 2024 I had my second internship with Spectrum as a Product Management Intern on the Mobile Product Team.
                        This internship gave me insight in what it's like to work in a fourtune 500 company and what goes into creating a customer 
                        facing self service platform with 32 million users. I immediately got hands on experience through attending meetings shadowing my 
                        mentor on her projects as well as having 4 projects of my own. In these projects I created Business Requirements documents
                        for tracking and to highlight the importance and outcomes of the projects. I also was in charge of creating the project tickets in Jira
                        and their associated user stories, Epics, and Lucid charts. In my lucid charts I summarized the problem, ways to solve it and made low fidelity 
                        mockup to quickly familiarize the team with the project and use during my meetings with the design team to kickstart ideation. I was also able 
                        to do backwards sprint planning and was invested in decision making for work to include in sprints and what to hold off for future sprints. 
                        Overall, my biggest takeaway from this internship was how big companies collaborate and ensure the product is the most reliable it can be for 
                        customer satisfaction.

                        Outside of my academics I like to hike, run, play guitar, read and do anything artistic. I am currently training for a 10k and one of my 
                        biggest acomplishments is that I ran a half maraton in high school. Being outside in general just brings me peace and I love 
                        being active. I also draw alot (as you can see from my portfolio). Mostly mixed media and I specficially like sketching with pen 
                        and paper. In the picture to the left is one drawing I'm most proud of which is a 6 foot drawing of a shoe made with charcoal!
