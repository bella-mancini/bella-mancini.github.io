  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p class="aboutUs">I made this project to raise awareness of the cost of being gay in our society. There are many people in 
    is world who hate gay people simply for their existance. This hatred causes gay people to fear coming out 
    and that is not the end of the fear. There is a price we pay for expressing ourselves and dressing how we feel most comfortable in our bodies.
    Not only for the fear of getting judged or having people dislike us simply for who we love but also knowing that 
    looking queer is specifically putting a target on our backs. Each day when we get dressed we put this target on our backs and 
    go through our day with the potential to get hate crimed. And when we go shopping there's an additional cost of not only money, 
    but also the cost of our safety and potentially our lives.
