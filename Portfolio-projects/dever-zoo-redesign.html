        <h3 class="subheading">summary</h3>
        <p>This case study is a redesign the Denver Zoo's ticket purchasing flow. 
            The current flow was confusing, had too many screens, and overall was not
            a user friendly experience. Making this process less confusing will decrease
            the ticket purchasing abandon rate and increase overall visitors. After redesigning
            the experience I was able to decrease the amount of screens from 10 to 6 and make the 
            process into a focused flow.<br> Here is a to <a class="link" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/jRMmNJJ29pYilnY6lDfLsW/UX1-2024-Bella-Mancini?node-id=6148-3927&t=XEj7ewii8XtYxPcF-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=5%3A348">my figma prototype</a>  to see the experience for

        <p>In my usability test I conducted two interviews. I then made
            an affinity map of the pain points seen below.

        <p>here are my three how might we statements based on 
            my competative analysis and affinity map:

        <li>How might we make the checkout process more concise?

        <li>How might we keep customers engaged in the checkout process?
            
        </li>
        <li>
            How might we communicate topics in a more focused manner?

        <p>For space and quatity reasons I have screen shots of the first 
            four wireframes at each level and a video walkthrough of the final
            prototype.
        </p><br>
        <p><strong>Low fidelity wireframe: In my low fidelity wireframes I focused
            on condensing the information to only what was nessecary. I also made 
            the ticket flow a no scroll experience to make it more straight forward.
        </strong> </p>
        <img  src="/img/lf-dz.png" alt="wireframe">
        <p>Mid fidelity wireframe: In the mid fidelity wireframe I began making everything
            more clean and figuring out spacing.
        </p>
        <img  src="/img/lmf-dz.png" alt="wireframe">
        <p>High fidelity wireframe version 1: For my high fidelity wireframe I added all my final colors
            and made the components along with making it usable. This part was a 
            big chunck of my project as in the midfidelity wireframe I didn't care much about being
            pixel perfect or having detail.

        <p>Through these interviews and going back through the  design

            <p>
                If I had more time on this I would do more user tests for my 
                final high fidelity wireframe to make sure it is as good as possible. I also 
                would work more on the fonts while i think it is ok but I 
                would like to do small tweaks so it feels perfect. Overall in the future I would 
                work in refining this expirence.
                <br> <br>
                I learned alot from this case study. Fisrt of all, I think it would have been more 
                helpful to have 5 inital user test as I was only able to
                get two it lowered the quality of my research results.
                In the future I'm going to be more research focused and spend more
                time on the inital planning.Because I didn't but as much detail into my 
                mid fidelity wireframe it too a really long time to get my high fidelity 
                prototype to where I want it to be.
